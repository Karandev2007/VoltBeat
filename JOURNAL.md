# Total time spent: 12h

### July 13 â€” Time Spent: 2 hours

* Finalized the project idea and name: **NexVolt**, A budget powerful powerbank
* Conducted initial research on features, necessary components, and design.
* sourced some basic parts too

---

### July 30 - Time Spend: 1 hour

* Change Name and Idea behhind this, now this is powerbank + a boom speaker, with 4x 3w speakers, 2 on front and 2 on sides with full control over sides. like i can turn only front or only sides or use both at once, cool right? :D, i wanted to make it powerful and cover more area, but then i thought sometimes we dont want to be in party mode just for normal usage with front only so i added this feature.
- I will be making something like this as im heavily inspired with this design.
